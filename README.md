# Housing-Prices
The csv file contains pricing data on 546 houses with 12 independent variables and furnishing status as the dependent variable.
The analysis starts with elementary EDA and moves into preparing the dummy variables for string data points in specific columns.
The data is then normalized and prepared for regression by random splitting into train and test sets.
The regression model is run and the results are analyzed. We supplement regression results with VIF and the co-relation matrix. We filter out the necessary variables and refine the model to achieve an RMSE of 0.09.
